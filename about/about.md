My name is [Rogin](http://twitter.com/RoginFarrer). I'm a senior drama major at Vassar College, where I do mostly design and technical theater. In my free time I like to write and design and build web sites.

After a few years of teaching myself, I have a pretty good handle on HTML, CSS, SASS, and Wordpress. I'm comfortable with PHP and Javascript, and I'm getting better all the time.

Whether I'm creating for the page or the stage, I'm passionate about **expression** and **story-telling**. I'm excited by the communication of ideas and emotion through performance, text, and design. 

### What is this about?

To be honest, I'm not sure yet. I like reading about and talking about tech, Apple, and design, so I'm sure you'll see a lot of that here. I can bet that a few of my other interests will slip in here, be it theater, productivity hacks, eating paleo, strength training, and well-being.

### Colophon

I designed and built this site with [Anchor](http://anchorcms.com), [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Compass](http://compass-style.org), and [Typekit](http://typekit.com). All copy is set in Ratio. Feel free to check out the [style guide](/styleguide).
