# Welcome to Superb Meteors

Hi there. My name is Rogin (pronounced like 'Seth ROGAN'), and I'm a theater-maker and pixel-pusher. I designed and built this site over and over again with the intention of hosting a place for me to express myself on the web. To be honest, I'm not sure why. For years I've admired the entrepreneurs and creatives who have built an audience by writing (e.g., [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com), [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net)) and the giants of literature in the 20th century (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Vonnegut). I've envied the life of the writer, but never put in the effort to actually write myself.
